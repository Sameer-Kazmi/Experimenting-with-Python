# Experimenting-with-Python
Welcome to my Python repository! This is where I'll be sharing my coding projects, exercises, and experiments as I learn and grow as a programmer.
I'm Sameer Kazmi, a Computer Science student at VIT Vellore. I'm passionate about learning and exploring the world of programming, starting with Python.
